## Aim of this project 
To find out which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines using the given dataset __wineQualityReds.csv__.

## Overview of the given dataset
The given dataset contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of wine. Atleast 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

## Attribute information:

   Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
   
   1 - fixed acidity (tartaric acid -  g/dm^3)  
   
   2 - volatile acidity (acetic acid - g/dm^3)  
   
   3 - citric acid (g/dm^3)  
   
   4 - residual sugar (g/dm^3)  
   
   5 - chlorides (sodium chloride - (g/dm^3)  
   
   6 - free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)  
   
   7 - total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)  
   
   8 - density (g/cm^3)  
   
   9 - pH  
   
   10 - sulphates (potassium sulphate - (g/dm3^)  
   
   11 - alcohol (% by volume)  
   
   __Output variable (based on sensory data):__
   
   12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)  
   
   13 - Missing Attribute Values: None

## Description of attributes:

   1 - fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)

   2 - volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste

   3 - citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines

   4 - residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet

   5 - chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine

   6 - free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine

   7 - total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine

   8 - density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content

   9 - pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale

   10 - sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant

   11 - alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine

   Output variable (based on sensory data): 
   12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
